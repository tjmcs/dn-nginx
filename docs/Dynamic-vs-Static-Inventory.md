# Dynamic vs. static inventory
The first decision to make is when using the playbook in this repository to deploy NGINX is whether you would like to manage the inventory for your deployments using the dynamic inventory scripts that are provided in the [common-utils](../common-utils) submodule for AWS and OpenStack environments or whether you are managing your inventory statically. Since the static inventory use case is the simplest, we'll start our discussion there. Then we'll move on to a discussion of how to control the deployment of NGINX in both AWS and OpenStack environments by tagging the VMs in those environments so that the dynamic inventory scripts from the [common-utils](../common-utils) submodule can be used to dynamically construct the lists of nodes that should be targeted by a given `ansible-playbook` run.

## Managing deployments with static inventory files
Let's assume that we are planning the deployment of a three-node NGINX cluster using the playbook in this repository and we are planning on using a [static inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html) to control that deployment. To do so, we're going to construct a static inventory file (an INI-like formatted file containing the list of hosts that are targeted by any given playbook run), and then pass that file into the `ansible-playbook` command using the `-i, --inventory-file` command-line flag. For purposes of this discussion, let's assume that the inventory file associated with our three-node NGINX cluster looks something like this:

```bash
$ cat test-cluster-inventory
# example inventory file for a clustered deployment

192.168.34.250 ansible_ssh_host= 192.168.34.250 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_user='cloud-user' ansible_ssh_private_key_file='keys/nginx_cluster_private_key'
192.168.34.251 ansible_ssh_host= 192.168.34.251 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_user='cloud-user' ansible_ssh_private_key_file='keys/nginx_cluster_private_key'
192.168.34.252 ansible_ssh_host= 192.168.34.252 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_ssh_user='cloud-user' ansible_ssh_private_key_file='keys/nginx_cluster_private_key'

[nginx]
192.168.34.250
192.168.34.251
192.168.34.252

$
```

As you can see, our static inventory file consists of a list of the hosts that are going to be accessed during our deployment and a single host group (the `nginx` host group). For each host in this file, we provide a list of the parameters that Ansible will need to connect to that host (INI-file style) as a set of `name=value` pairs. In this example, we've defined the following values for each of the entries in our static inventory file:

* **`ansible_ssh_host`**: the hostname/address that Ansible should use to connect to that host; if not specified, the same hostname/address listed at the start of the line for that entry for that host will be used (in this example we are using IP addresses). This parameter can be important when there are multiple network interfaces on each host and only one of them (an admin network, for example) allows for SSH access
* **`ansible_ssh_port`**: the port that Ansible should use when connecting to the host via SSH; if not specified, Ansible will attempt to connect using the default SSH port (port 22)
* **`ansible_ssh_user`**: the username that Ansible should use when connecting to the host via SSH; if not specified, then the value of the global `ansible_user` variable will be used (this variable can be set as an extra variable in the `ansible-playbook` command if the same username is used for all hosts targeted by the playbook run)
* **`ansible_ssh_private_key_file`**: the private key file that should be used when connecting to the host via SSH; if not specified, then the value of the global `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` variable will be used instead (this variable can be set as an extra variable in the `ansible-playbook` command if the same private key is used for all hosts targeted by the playbook run)

With this static inventory file built, it's a relatively simple matter to deploy our NGINX cluster using a single `ansible-playbook` command. Examples of these commands are shown [here](Deployment-Scenarios.md).

## Managing deployments using dynamic inventory scripts
For both AWS and OpenStack environments, the playbooks in this repository support the use of a [dynamic inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html) to control deployments to those environments. This is accomplished by making use of the [build-app-host-groups](../common-roles/build-app-host-groups) common role, which builds the host groups that are needed for the playbook run by filtering the hosts in the AWS or OpenStack environment, based on the tags that are assigned them and the tags that were included in the `ansible-playbook` command. This provides an attractive alternative to building static inventory files to control the deployment process in these environments, since the meta-data needed to determine which nodes should be targeted by a given playbook run is readily available in the framework itself.

The process of using the [build-app-host-groups](../common-roles/build-app-host-groups) common role to control a playbook run starts out by tagging the VMs that are going to be the target of a particular deployment with the following tags:

* **Tenant**: the tenant that will be using the NGINX cluster being deployed. As an example, you might use a value of `labs` for this tag for NGINX clusters that the Labs department in your organization will be using)
* **Project**: this tag will be given the value of the project that will be using the NGINX cluster that is being deployed; for example we might use the value `projectx` for this tag for clusters that will be used for ProjectX
* **Domain**: this tag is used to separate out the various domains that might be defined by the project team to control their deployments. For example, there might be separate clusters built for `development`, `test`, `preprod`, and `production`. Each of these environments would be tagged appropriately based on their intended use.
* **Application**: this tag is used to identify the application that should be deployed to a given virtual machine; in this playbook only nodes that are tagged with the application `nginx` are targeted by default (and although the application name is something you could customize, we recommend against doing so)

Once these tags have been assigned to the VMs that will be targeted by a given NGINX deployment, it is a relatively simple process to define values for the tags that should be targeted by the `ansible-playbook` command (as extra variables or in a *local variables file*, for example). Specifically, the following variables must be defined when using this dynamic inventory to manage a playbook run:

* **tenant**
* **project**
* **domain**
* **application**

Note that the `application` value defaults to `nginx` (the default value defined at the top of the [vars/nginx.yml](../vars/nginx.yml) file), so this value does not really need to be redefined as part of the `ansible-playbook` command or in a or in a *local variables file*, but it is shown here for completeness.

With these values assigned as part of the `ansible-playbook` command or in a or in a *local variables file*, the [build-app-host-groups](../common-roles/build-app-host-groups) role that is used by this playbook can correctly identify the nodes in the AWS or OpenStack environment that are targeted by a given playbook run and then use the resulting (dynamically constructed) host group to control the deployment of NGINX to the just those nodes that will make up the cluster being built.
